            hello.<br>

        <p>
            if you're here, you've traced the trail of delusions which spiraled into calamity.<br>
            to be clear, the use of binary spam across my posts made about two years ago pointing you to this site is not a continuation of the psychosis.<br>
            i used it to lead you here.<br> 
            <br> 
            to be clear, the thread of accounts, comments, and posts you've observed are the product of grandiose delusions.<br>
            that being said, they are laced with truths and legitimate ideas which gradually faded into nonsensical, mentally ill gobbledy gook.<br>
            this site is rudimentary, but it serves only to communicate my ideas.<br>
            <br>
            all that being said, welcome. 
            <br><br>

        <p>
            <br> For now, the organization of this page will be rudimentary. <br>
            It will be a linear stream of text with (ctrl+F) markers. <br>

            <br>Life has persisted for billions of years. We constantly think about how incomprehensible this amount of time is, but what is even remarkable is comparing it to humanity's rapid accelleration.<br>
            <br>Across the span of only ten thousand years, we organized into complex societies and began rapidly populating the earth with man-made constructions.
            <br>During this time, our capacity to see what is both large and small developed from basic micro/telescopes, to instruments capable of observing atoms and black holes.
            <br>Human thought has ballooned a thousand fold since the rennasiance. Language communicates absurdly complex ideas, incomprehensible to those a hundred years prior today.  
            <br>In the last few decades, growth has exceeded the billions of years of evolution leading up to this point.
            <br><br>Computing marks the trigger which flung us into today's state of rapid technological expansion.
            <br>It is the foundation of all science, as theory depends on the digital technology necessary to apply it.
            <br>The Apollo missions relied on digital computers, including the manufacturing which precisely made the rocket's components.
            <br>Digitally enhanced manufacturing produces everything man-made in the most literal sense.
            <br>As stated earlier, we can now see so large and small that it exceeds the level of incomprehensibility associated with our 6 billion year existence.
            <br>I type this on a digital machine, and disseminate it using modern communication infrastructure.
            <br>It goes without saying that the integration of phones, computers, and other digital communication technology is the framework of humanity's modern society.
            <br><br>We live in the digital age.
            <br>The era of information.
            <br><br>Computing is the nexus between billions of years of prior evolution, and our inevitable expansion into space and the incomprehensible unknown.
            <br><br>It is critical to recognize that this does not have significance only in the progress of humanity, but rather life as a whole
            <br>Humanity is merely a step in life's greater trajectory, not some isolated entity which we ought consider distinct from nature.
            <br><br>This is the grandiosity associated with Claude Shannon and his work.
            <br>Through his masters thesis, which attached boolean logic to circuit design, and A Mathematical Theory of Communication, which coined the term digital* and applied binary to information systems,
            <br>It is undeniable that his work is the foundation for all digital information systems, computers, as is Einstein to relativity, and Newton to classical mechanics.
            <br>He is, both literally and colloquially, the Father of Information Theory.
            <br><br>We live in the digital age.
            <br>The era of information.<br>
            <br>From these fundamental, undeniable observations, Claude Shannon is at that nexus between old and new.
            <br>He exists at the center of all evolution.
            <br>Hence the grandiosity.
            <br><br>All that being said, although his life is the single most pivotal event in the history of everything, the manic association is clear.
            <br>Identifying yourself as the reincarnation of such an individual means that you are the center of the universe. 
            <br>Textbook mania. Couldn't be clearer.
            <br>Recognizing Claude Shannon as the center of the universe is not necessarily manic, as it arises from fundamental observations.
            <br>As soon as you attribute yourself to his grandios existence, so begin the delusions.
            <br><br>We live in the digital age.
            <br>The era of information.<br>
            <br>The age and era of Claude Shannon.
