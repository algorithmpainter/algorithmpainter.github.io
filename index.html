            Prior to this experience I'd already dosed mescaline (San Pedro) and shrooms many times, and acid once, so I'd already experienced the smell initial deeply meaningful experience that psychedelics provide on numerous occasions. The one time I did acid before was (allegedly) three 150ug tabs, and it produced a relatively intense, somewhat lengthy trip. Because I'd done 450ug prior, I dosed five 100ug and expected a similarly intense result. These tabs were from a different dealer. The level of intensity is incomparable. Truly. It was so much more intense and vivid that I cant put a number to it, other than infinity. I'd branded myself a true psychonaut, having dosed large quantities of all true psychedelics (except for DMT, which I believe to be the final frontier). At the peak I experienced the absolute. An image of the universe in its entirety, or at least the fabric by which it is comprised, and the patterns which guide the macroscopic progression of things. We are the universe experiencing itself. From a fabric of everything emerges something, a seed from which the entire universe stems. From this seed blossoms everything, shaped by binary laws such as black and white, up and down, big and small, equal and opposite. Life counter the entropy of our physical universe. The two are the antithesis of one another; life is a whirlpool of order in a greater sea of chaos. One discounts life by saying that it will still eventually decay to disorder along with everything else, but the forward progression of life rapidly outpaces the physical. Consider the abundance of hydrogen in our universe. We know that through nuclear fusion it is possible to harness all of this energy. It will take hundreds of billions of years, trillions even, for the universe to decay to a point where we can no longer build. If you want to calculate the end of the universe, it is not a "heat death," but rather that time wherein the expansion of the universe meets the speed of light (eventually things will be moving away from one another so fast that the speed of light cannot reach one galaxy to another). But consider what we have done with only thousands of years, and a cosmoloigcally insignifigant amount of energy relative to that which is available to us in the greater universe. Given an incomprehensibly large, functionally infinate amount of potential, will we not reach levels of incomprehensibility which inevitably alters our reality to the point where what we perceive as physical limitations change, as they have since the emergence of single cell organisms? Life, in its entirety, is one coherent thing, and that which comprises what we conceptualize as The Universe. As humans, we are a vessel such that the universe can experience itself, as is every other organism on earth. If we are comprised of single cells, which make organelles, organs, blood, and everything present in the human body, can we not extrapolate from that pattern the notion that all human beings are like cells in a greater fabric of humanity, and thus life? We are the universe experiencing itself. I believe psychedelics unveile this truth, and profound experiences constantly make one feel an undeniable connection to the absolute. This is evident in the common experience which fuels a study like this. I also have the ability to logically lay out all of this. The above is very reductive, and it sounds pretentious, but summarizes the core beliefs that I derived from this intense LSD experience. To provide you with a simple logical chain, devoid of explanation: Cells divide Organisms evolve Humans move forward technologically All of this relies on externally provided energy. Life generates order The physical universe tends towards disorder Macroscopically, life and entropy are the antithesis of one another. Either the expansion of the universe or eventual heat death will render life unable to become increasingly complex. Both can be calculated, namely the cosmological horizon(?) (expansion + speed of light. This affords life at least a few billion years to harness the potential of the physical universe. Fusion is certainly possible We've already achieved nuclear ignition (generation of more energy than that which is necessary to unitiate a fusion reaction). Nuclear fusion allows us to harness hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, for totally clean energy. Just as we can calculate the amount of time we have, we can also calculate the amount of hydrogen in the observable universe alone. Life has evolved for billions of years. Evolution generated humanity. In the last thousand years, humanity has acquired the ability to thoerorize about these things, observe them, experiment, verify, etc. Tech has gone from steam engines to rockets in the last few hundred years. In the last 30 years, computing has seemingly integrated into every day human life. We have the ability to go to space. The expansion of the universe is exponential. Given a few billion years and a googol of hydrogen, is it fair to say that our present understanding of the physical universe will be so radically altered that none of these concerns even matter? All of this is inevitable, and in accordance with the law of reverse entropy, or life. More importantly, I have an absolute belief in this truth by virtue of having observed and experienced it myself, as others have on psychedelics, namely heroic doses. So this experience has absolved me of any existential dread. I do not fear death itself, only the pain in transit. Because of the binary nature of our universe, karma, equivalent exchange, good for good and bad for bad, every decision has meaning. Love is the most transcendental feature of humanity, and it is something I seek more than material gains. I have an immovable optimism about life and the universe. Not just mine, but that which will develop in the coming thousand, million, and billion years. I try to write about it, to capture it and put it into words, as I've done here, but because I have bipolar, there's a fine line between truth and psychosis. The logic and conclusions are so grandiose that they are discounted. I will continue to communicate it, so that others can share my existential optimism, but I truly believe that psychedelics allow people to experience this absolute in an undeniable way, void of any logic. These dots connected during this trip, as it was immeasurably more intense than the other thirty or so trips I've had, even on these tabs (I kept it to 2 tops). Another brief note, I believe that there are few characteristics which define true psychedelics (distinct from molly, 2CB, etc). These can serve as a coherent, concrete set of features that describe the technical elements of psychedelics. 1. Ego dissolution (ego death in heroic doses, as was mine. total disconnection from self and experience of the absolute. 2. Time dilation. Generally this makes it such that one will experience miniutes within a minute, or "slow downs" so extreme that they meet ththe same infinity as ego dissolution. 3. sensory hallucinations (visual, auditory, etc). Not much to describe here. The physical properties: 1. Exponentially scaling intensity. A line of coke is a line of coke, a drink is a drink, a parachute is a parachute, a cigarette a cigarette, etc. Limits are finite and calculable. With any true psychedelic, namely acid, the difference between one and two tabs is insane. Now image 5 tabs, yeesh. 2. Lack of a "hangover." Trips generally leave an afterglow, or one feeling refreshed. Drugs like molly shot your dopamine for days. 3. Lack of addictive potential. I got addicted to psychedelics, it happens, but I am an anomoly. People very rarely have the urge to consume more and more psychedelics. No withdrawals. 4. It won't kill you if you do too much of it. Based on this criteria, marijuana meets the standards for a true psychedelic, although addictive potential is certainly there. It's less than other drugs, but surprisingly widespread. I also believe doses are exponential until you reach a point of frequent use or dependency. The difference between a 25 and 75mg edible is no joke. My first time smoking large quantities was similarly intense and comparable to acid. To rank the true psychedelics in order of intensity: DMT LSD Psylociben Mescaline (THC) Similar to dosing, each psychedelic in this hierarchy is exponentially more intense, but this could be subjective.

            if you're here, you've traced the trail of delusions which spiraled into calamity.<br>
            to be clear, the use of binary spam across my posts made about two years ago pointing you to this site is not a continuation of the psychosis.<br>
            i used it to lead you here.<br> 
            <br> 
            to be clear, the thread of accounts, comments, and posts you've observed are the product of grandiose delusions.<br>
            that being said, they are laced with truths and legitimate ideas which gradually faded into nonsensical, mentally ill gobbledy gook.<br>
            this site is rudimentary, but it serves only to communicate my ideas.<br>
            <br>
            all that being said, welcome. 
            <br><br>

            <br> For now, the organization of this page will be rudimentary. <br>
            It will be a linear stream of text with (ctrl+F) markers. <br>

            <br>Life has persisted for billions of years. We constantly think about how incomprehensible this amount of time is, but what is even remarkable is comparing it to humanity's rapid accelleration.<br>
            <br>Across the span of only ten thousand years, we organized into complex societies and began rapidly populating the earth with man-made constructions.
            <br>During this time, our capacity to see what is both large and small developed from basic micro/telescopes, to instruments capable of observing atoms and black holes.
            <br>Human thought has ballooned a thousand fold since the rennasiance. Language communicates absurdly complex ideas, incomprehensible to those a hundred years prior today.  
            <br>In the last few decades, growth has exceeded the billions of years of evolution leading up to this point.
            <br><br>Computing marks the trigger which flung us into today's state of rapid technological expansion.
            <br>It is the foundation of all science, as theory depends on the digital technology necessary to apply it.
            <br>The Apollo missions relied on digital computers, including the manufacturing which precisely made the rocket's components.
            <br>Digitally enhanced manufacturing produces everything man-made in the most literal sense.
            <br>As stated earlier, we can now see so large and small that it exceeds the level of incomprehensibility associated with our 6 billion year existence.
            <br>I type this on a digital machine, and disseminate it using modern communication infrastructure.
            <br>It goes without saying that the integration of phones, computers, and other digital communication technology is the framework of humanity's modern society.
            <br><br>We live in the digital age.
            <br>The era of information.
            <br><br>Computing is the nexus between billions of years of prior evolution, and our inevitable expansion into space and the incomprehensible unknown.
            <br><br>It is critical to recognize that this does not have significance only in the progress of humanity, but rather life as a whole
            <br>Humanity is merely a step in life's greater trajectory, not some isolated entity which we ought consider distinct from nature.
            <br><br>This is the grandiosity associated with Claude Shannon and his work.
            <br>Through his masters thesis, which attached boolean logic to circuit design, and A Mathematical Theory of Communication, which coined the term digital* and applied binary to information systems,
            <br>It is undeniable that his work is the foundation for all digital information systems, computers, as is Einstein to relativity, and Newton to classical mechanics.
            <br>He is, both literally and colloquially, the Father of Information Theory.
            <br><br>We live in the digital age.
            <br>The era of information.<br>
            <br>From these fundamental, undeniable observations, Claude Shannon is at that nexus between old and new.
            <br>He exists at the center of all evolution.
            <br>Hence the grandiosity.
            <br><br>All that being said, although his life is the single most pivotal event in the history of everything, the manic association is clear.
            <br>Identifying yourself as the reincarnation of such an individual means that you are the center of the universe. 
            <br>Textbook mania. Couldn't be clearer.
            <br>Recognizing Claude Shannon as the center of the universe is not necessarily manic, as it arises from fundamental observations.
            <br>As soon as you attribute yourself to his grandios existence, so begin the delusions.
            <br><br>We live in the digital age.
            <br>The era of information.<br>
            <br>The age and era of Claude Shannon.
